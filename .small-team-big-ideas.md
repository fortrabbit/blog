## Ambition VS reality

We want to build the best PHP hosting platform in the world. We want to compete with the giants. But we are a small team. We don't have VC money to burn. We don't have hundreds of engineers. This gap is where the tension lies. It's also where the creativity comes from.

## How we prioritize

It's easy to get overwhelmed by the endless list of bugs, feature requests, and cool ideas.

* RICE: "reach," "impact," "confidence," and "effort"
* High impact, low effort is rare. High impact, high effort is worth it if it moves the needle.
* Customer support driven development and feature prioritization
* Gut feeling
* Good ideas are fragile, file everything, keep it around, re-visit.
* Saying no is really hard.

## Slow shipping

fortrabbit might not be a fast paced high velocity team.

## Guilty of lifestyle entrepreneurhip

We are building a business that supports our lives, not a unicorn. I am a "lifestyle entrepreneur", in a sense that I am very invested in the topic, willing to take a long way.

* Sustainable pace: We avoid burnout. We want to be doing this in 10 years.
* Work-life balance: We work to live, we don't live to work.
* Independence: Being bootstrapped means we answer only to our customers and ourselves.

## Conclusion

It's a constant balancing act. Sometimes we drop the ball. Sometimes we get distracted. But by reminding ourselves to focus, prioritize, and take it one step at a time, we keep moving forward. Slowly, but surely.
