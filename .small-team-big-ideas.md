Our [new platform launched in BETA](/new-platform-beta.md) recently. That was a big milestone for us. But there is still a mountain of work ahead before we can drop that BETA flag. We are competing with giants. We don't have VC money to burn. We are just 5 developers. How do we even cope?

## Irrationality

> They didn't knew it was impossible. So they dit it.

It might not be as simple as Mark Twain puts it. But spinning up a reality distortion field and ignoring gravity helps me. Maintain a childish naivity to keep going. Don't get overwhelmed. Don't think (too much).

## Planning

> Plans are useless. But planning is everything.

We humans are really bad at planning. Let's embrace that. We plan the known knowns. We try to anticipate the known unknowns. And we expect the unknown unknowns to hit us anyhow.

## Prioritization

I got better over the years at turning fuzzy ideas into actionable tasks. We look at reach, impact, confidence, and effort (RICE) for new ideas. Good gut feeling (learned a lot from my co-founder Oli) and domain knowledge are required, [customer support driven development](/support-driven-development.md) also helps to see signal.

Saying "no" to ideas is hard. I file each new idea, keep it around, and revisit it after a while. A little distance often helps to see things clearer. Good ideas are fragile, but the best ones stick.

## Distraction

> Keep calm and carry on coding.

Don't look at the scary news in the world. Don't try to figure if AI will kill your industry. Don't compare yourself against competitors (just steel the best ideas).

## Slow shipping

We are fortunate to have a stable financial situation. That buys us some time. But we need to be careful about this precious resource too.

## Stay healthy

I am also guilty of being a "lifestyle entrepreneur". I am deeply invested and willing to take the long road. Being at fortrabit doesn't feel like work.

We try to avoid burnout and maintain a healthy relation to our work. Our business shall support not consume our lives.
