## Intro

We came a long way since Gutenberg invented mass media with the printing machine (1450). It's also been a while (1993) since Tim Berners-Lee published the first website introducing the world wide web. Where are we heading now?

Social media, no-code platforms and AI tools have made content creation easier ever before. Publishing your own website is a rather technical path. Is custom web development becoming a relic of the past?

## Walled gardens

> In our techno-feudalistic dystopia, they're the landlords. We're the serfs.

Attention economy: Social media silos and app stores have the eye balls. They also own the rules. When the algorithm sneezes, businesses catch a cold. Walled gardens are convenient as long as you comply.

Owning your content means hosting it on your own domain, controlling the URLs, and deciding how long it stays online.

## Quirky and naive

Looking at my filter bubble of web dev and web design, I see a renaissance of the naive web happening. Just like vinyl diggers, people are looking at ways to create expressive, naive and a quirky web, using open standards.

Handmade layouts, intentional asymmetry, stubborn color palettes, and copy that feels like it was written by a person. Keeping the web playful, opinionated, and weird in the best possible way.

## A sacred craft

Wheel reinventing.

A community that celebrates talent, creativity, and determined work is the antidote to low‑code tooling.

## No bloatware

Every time we choose a 40 MB JavaScript framework to render a three‑line headline, a puppy dies. Framework fatigue is a thing.

## Open formats

Markdown is still a joy. RSS and WebSub still deliver posts to people who actually asked for them. Microformats (h-card, rel=\"me\", IndieAuth), Webmention, and ActivityPub glue personal sites together without yet another proprietary API. Backup your exports, publish in durable formats, and your words will outlive product sunsets.

## IndieWeb routes and web rings

You don't have to do this solo. The IndieWeb movement documents POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), web mention etiquette, and protocol basics. Web rings never died — they just moved. Here are a few worth surfing:

## Self hosting? Maybe

Self‑hosting is empowering until it isn't. Hardware fails, dashboards break, security updates pile up. Drew Lyton's "The future is no" self‑hosted" is a good reminder that managed platforms exist for a reason. That said, running your own stack is still a great way to learn — just go in with eyes wide open.

## How we try to help

I am interested in all that. I imagine that web hosting can become a nice niche that we'll be happy to serve.

fortrabbit sits somewhere between raw VPS and SaaS. We operate the boring parts (infrastructure, backups, TLS, PHP runtimes).

We're building tools that make it easier to host those personal, opinionated projects.

## You?

Write the long, nerdy essay. Launch the tiny tool that scratches your itch. Link your friends, join a ring, own your content. The web is better when you show up.
