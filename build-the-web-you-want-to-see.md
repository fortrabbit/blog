## Intro

We came a long way since Gutenberg invented mass media with the printing machine (1450). It's also been a while (1993) since Tim Berners-Lee published the first website introducing the world wide web. Where are we heading now?

<!-- With classical media (print, TV, radio) there are a few senders and a lot of receivers. The internet allowed to make everyone a sender, which certainly is a challenge to society (but that is a different subject). -->

Publishing your own website is a rather technical. Social media, no-code platforms and the rise of AI tools have made content creation more accessible than ever before. Is custom web development becoming a relic of the past?

> In our techno-feudalistic dystopia, they're the landlords. We're the serfs.

An old sacred craft like an Alchemy?

The medium is the message  
Wheel reinventors  
'Not Invented Here Syndrome' VS wheel re-inventors?  
A community that supports talent, creativity and determined work
