We have presented the fortrabbit platform at the last [Berlin PHP usergroup meeting](http://www.bephpug.de/). See the slides [here](https://github.com/berlinphp/berlinphp.github.com/blob/master/folien/fortrabbit-bephpug-2012-11-s.pdf).

I am a terrible speaker. Plus that i was totally nervous - knowing to be the guy with the least PHP knowledge in the room, holding a kind of startup pitch talk instead of an interesting tech demo for this really up-to-date audience. So thanks again not only for having us but also for backing us up so much. We really appreciate this and hope that we can contribute more in the future.
