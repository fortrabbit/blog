The counter of total accounts changed today from 3 to 4 digits - we are very excited. 1,000 PHP developers signed up, confirmed their email, created Apps and deployed code. The majority of you explored our platform during the last 6 weeks. We belief 1,000 is just a fraction - there are zillions of other developers who never heard about us. For us, 3 guys with a simple idea of better platform for PHP developers, this tiny number and your feedback shows that there was something missing in the current PaaS-World. It shows we are on the right way, with the right tools and the right attitude to make make it big.

A big THANK YOU goes out to Bruno Skvorc and Gabriel Manricks. They mentioned us in their articles at [phpmaster.com](http://phpmaster.com/php-as-a-service-fortrabbit/) and [net.tutsplus.com](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-staging-environment/)
