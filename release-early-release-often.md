**Ready or Not – here i come?** Can we really go live that early? Shouldn't we do a public BETA period to gain more feedback first? __ _We think: YES we can!_ You can read it in any startup advice book: Launch early. Our new cloud hosting service is general available since yesterday. We build it within a fairly short time (~12 months) and had only a short closed BETA period (~1 month). We do managed hosting for over 5 years – a business where reliability is one of the core values. And Platform as a Service is just a label for a modern approach of scalable hassle-free hosting solutions. This PaaS market is very young and still a changing category in the wide field of cloud hosting. [Listening](http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2012/10/cloud-hosting-php-pipe-dream) to customers and their needs will influence the way current services work. 

### Is our platform really mature or yet another MVP or even just a tech demo?

We hope that you take the time and check it out yourself. Our full featured freemium plan comes handy here. Please consider: 

  * **It's built on top of AWS**. We are standing on shoulders of giants. We don't have to take care of all the bare metal.
  * **Our design is paranoid.** Relying on AWS is not enough. Nearly all components are redundant and in different availability zones.
  * **The underlying core software is proven to be stable.** De facto standard hosting components: Debian, Apache, Puppet, grsecurity & HAproxy
  * **We are experienced.** Our first generation hosting, a dedicated stack of own hardware, is still running. Uptime: 99.9%

We are a a [small agile team](http://fortrabbit.com/about). Instead of trying to build an "[egg-laying wool-milk-sow](https://www.google.com/search?q=egg-laying+wool-milk-sow&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&tbm=isch)" we focused on a  optimized PHP stack. **It's just LAMP with deployment candy on top, but we like it.** The most important features, the ones you will need in production, are included – with attention to detail. The [documentation](http://support.fortrabbit.com/) is very complete. Our unique r/w-storage solution allows all type of work-flows. Billing works, you can pay with credit card and will get a nice PDF invoice each month. We tested everything intensively and integrated feedback from our BETA testers (thanks again!). From our perspective we've released a very solid 1.0 stable. But it's software and it cuts both ways: Things go wrong sometimes but they are easy to fix. We are looking forward to get more great [feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE1LVHowMTVXM1pVX2FLZFpxNXlpdUE6MQ) (criticism & props) to move on the next release.
