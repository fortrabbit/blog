How many times have you read something like this: "This is the first video of a new upcoming screen-cast series…"?

And how many times this was the only video of the planned sequel? Producing tutorial videos is a hassle. We know that. But screen-casts are a great way to show how something really works. OK, here we go: _This is the first video of a new how-to-videos series where we are showing off our worst practices of development & deployment on our PHP platform. _

Learn here about one way (out of many) to set up a quick Hello World example on the fabulous fortrabbit PHP hosting platform. See the handy PhpStorm IDE, gorgeous Git version control and the funky dependency manager PHP Composer in action. Sublime Text is not the only code editor as you can see - PhpStorm is a full featured but lightweight IDE for all operating systems. It helps you to understand what's going on in your PHP code. This video was filmed in full color in Linux cinemascope. Please enlarge or use fullscreen mode and switch to HD to get the details. This video was written and produced by our chief engineer Ulrich Kautz.
