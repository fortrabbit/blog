UDPATE 2014: Boarding Bonus is not available any more.


- - - -

We have just released the new [tasklist](/the-new-tasklist/) lately. Now we optimize the boarding process further with a new experiment: The boarding bonus – an extended test drive.

Now, new accounts have the possibility, for 14 days after sign up, to get an extra credit, of 25 €. To claim the Boarding Bonus users need to enter their payment credentials – opt-out is possible of course. This is a great way to check out some of our advanced features – such as the [workers add-on](http://fortrabbit.com/docs/in-depth/workers). More infos can be found [here](http://fortrabbit.com/docs/how-to/misc/boarding-bonus). Thanks again for flying with fortrabbit.
