<!-- Welcome to the modern age of AI-powered cold contact, the most sophisticated SPAM ever. Let's embrace it as a form of art until my AI powered conuter measures will learn to fight back. -->

## Hi Frank

> just put together a pre-hire simulation for Fortrabbit to assess how your applicants will execute tasks they'll actually do on-the-job (no quizzes or multi-choice fluff) It will generate a demonstrated skills scorecard based on each candidate's performance, cutting days in pre-screening and interviews. Should I send over how it works? P.S. Bloomberg, EY & Athena have increased candidate conversion by 3x.

> I'm writing to share a high-impact opportunity for Fortrabbit to secure partnerships with the biggest names in the food and beverage industry. Our upcoming European Food Manufacturing Summit gathers a curated audience of over 120 senior executives from companies like Ferrero, Mars, Mondelez, Unilever and more. We believe this is the ideal environment for you to bypass the gatekeepers and network directly with top-tier decision-makers. A key highlight of this sponsorship is the opportunity to speak on Day 2 in front of over 120 decision-makers, as well as to host a Lunch & Learn with 10 senior executives who select your table, allowing you to lead the conversation and demonstrate your value directly to potential partners. Let's ensure your organization starts the year with a strategic advantage. Are you free for a brief 15-minute chat next week to walk through the details?

> Following up to see whether Fortrabbit has any projects for 2026 that may benefit from additional engineering resources or expertise.  Our professional services include Dedicated software development teams, Custom software development, Software audit and Software maintenance. With 96% senior engineers and ISO 27001 / ISO 9001 certified processes, we ensure secure, reliable, and high-quality delivery. When applicable, we accelerate development using our in-house solutions, including: Data collection platform, Data quality checker, Dashboard UI components library, Mobile kit for building control apps. These tools help shorten development timelines while maintaining consistency and quality. Would you be available for a short conversation to see if our expertise could support your 2026 goals?

> We launched a tool that lets you be SOC2/ISO2701/HIPAA compliant in record speed. In June this helped Capgo become SOC2 compliant in <24h & they got their attestation just 9 days later. Respond 'yes' if you'd like me to send you a signup link.

> I wanted to follow up on my last note in case it got buried in your inbox. We've been helping companies like Fortrabbit quickly scale their dev, design, and marketing teams with pre-vetted remote talent, and I'd love to show you what that could look like for your team. No long hiring cycles or hidden fees, just great people, ready to plug in and deliver. If you're open, I'd be happy to share a few profiles so you can see the quality firsthand. Just let me know! Looking forward to hearing from you.

> I am XXX, founder of XXX. We help SaaS founders recover failed payments and improve retention automatically. Would you be open to a short chat to see what we could unlock for Fortrabbit?

> I see Fortrabbit.com is DR 61 and 372 traffic/mo on Ahrefs. I call it a good takeoff, but is SEO a priority in Q1 '26? If yes, we'd love to slide in. We specialize in SaaS SEO and SaaS SEO only. Links, contents and technical SEO, we cover all 3 grounds of it.

> I hope this note finds you well. I came across Fortrabbit and I think we can collaborate. At XXXX, we help startups and growing companies scale quickly with skilled offshore engineers, designers, and digital experts, often at up to 5x lower cost than local hiring. To make it risk-free, we offer a complimentary 20-hour trial project so you can experience our team's work before committing. Would you be open to a short call to see if this could support your goals now or in future?

> Quick question, would you pay $100 per qualified sales meeting? In the past, I would in a heartbeat...  Until this software started producing them for $11.70. 10,000 of them in fact. (My sales reps think Im a fucking wizard). It breaks the agency and paid ads model. It researches hundreds of prospect data points & 'Glove Fits' emails at scale Launches to 150k dream prospects, 2 minutes after signing up. Does everything with AI, after it gets to know Fortrabbit. There is no contract. It is the same price as a fancy dinner. There's also a free trial! (Don't share this with anyone)

> Are you guys adopting an AI strategy currently? We would love to exchange some thoughts with you on that. No harm in having a quick chat on Teams or Zoom?

> I'm currently on Fortrabbit.com - Your company is potentially leaving five to six-figure funding amounts on the table, often without your knowledge. We have been successfully supporting companies for over five years in applying for research grants and I just learned about your MySQL 8. The chances are good that we can secure funding for you, I have one or two quick follow-up questions about that. I would already prepare a calculation for you, showing exactly what funding amount you can expect, let's have a quick phone call in the coming days. When would be the best time to reach you?

> We've put together a customer acquisition infrastructure that scales like ads with 0 ad spend. Your offer gets put in front of 10,000+ ideal clients each day. Sounds interesting?

> Following up briefly to highlight that our experienced developers can help you leverage AI agents to revolutionize operations in your managed cloud hosting platform for PHP applications by streamlining Git deployment to reduce downtime, intelligently managing server resources for optimal performance and cost efficiency, automating troubleshooting for faster resolution times, and enhancing security protocols to protect against vulnerabilities. I'm interested in discussing how AI agents are revolutionizing operations in the Information Technology industry. Nestack Technologies empowers businesses to develop and deploy AI agents for complex tasks, seamlessly integrating them into automation workflows.

> We are inviting your esteemed company for vendors registration and intending partners for Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) 2025/2026 projects. These projects are open for all companies around the world, if you have intention to participate in the process, please confirm your interest by asking for Vendor Questionnaire and EOI. We appreciate your interest in this invitation and look forward to your early response.

> This is my last email. If you're spending 6-8 weeks to hire a developer, you're losing money. Each week a role remains unfilled is a week you miss out on new projects. It's an opportunity cost you can't recover. In 72 hours, our hiring automation system identifies, qualifies, and technically evaluates candidates. $0 for your next hire. You only pay if you actually found someone useful. If you need to scale your team faster, reply to me with a good time. Otherwise, best of luck with job boards.

> I know it's the weekend and this email is probably sandwiched between brunch plans and ignoring notifications (respect!). I'll keep it short and skip the salesy jazz. We're not an average IT shop. We build custom software, top-tier cybersecurity, seamless integrations, and AI/ML solutions tailored to your business goals. We've been at it for 18+ years, with teams in 30+ countries. If you're curious, we can hop on a quick 15-minute call with case studies and real-world results in hand, no fluff Interested in a call next week? I promise we'll keep it useful, no PowerPoint pain. What do you say?

> Apologies for reaching out directly to your inbox. We are offering you free access to our 2026 AI Strategic LMS software — an easy-to-use and customizable platform that automates daily tasks assigned to Chief Executive Officer at Fortrabbit, in a single click. Would you spare 30 seconds to watch the process video walkthrough over email?

At XXXX, we help businesses accelerate growth through AI agents, custom software, workflow automation, low-code apps, and real-time dashboards built to fit any industry.

> We can improve Fortrabbit's customer engagement through tailored communication, enhancing sales conversions and reducing lead time. Mind if I forward some information your way?

> Just wanted to check in and see if Fortrabbit already uses any tools built on stripe to recover failed payments or improve trial conversions. If not, I can share what other computer networking founders are doing to recover 15% to 40% of lost revenue automatically, especially companies that operate as a managed cloud hosting platform for php web developers and agencies. Would you like me to send over my calendar?

> Big news in your space. Anthropic just acquired leading developer tool startup Bun. Buyer interest in software publishers is surging, and companies like yours are in high demand amongst the investors. Recently, two investors missed out on a business similar to yours and are actively looking to acquire in your niche. At XXXX, we've closed 1,500+ SaaS and digital services deals. Right now, we're offering a free, no-obligation valuation for founders exploring their next move. Interested in seeing what Fortrabbit could be worth in today's market? Let's talk.

> Was wondering if you'd be interested in learning more about a pre-hire simulation we built for Fortrabbit that helps you identify top performers early and cut your screening time by almost half?

> I wanted to follow up on my last note in case it got buried in your inbox.

> Frank - Noticed you sell to web developers to offer them PHP hosting as a Service. With XXXX AI, you can send personalized emails to them directly at scale. (And we have so much data on these groups specifically.) It's the simplest and most cost-efficient way to fill top-of-funnel - without bringing on more staff. Worth discussing?

> Figured you didn't start your php cloud hosting platform just to stop booking calls every time client work ramps up. Not sure if it's a fit, but we've helped over 400 scale their 'Zero-Ad Scaling Blueprint' using a tool without extra effort, head count or complexity. Specifically, I think it could help you build a repeatable social proof system that uses Shealan Forshaw's success to trigger both direct replies and inbound leads from developers frustrated with traditional hosting solutions. If you'd find more info on this system useful send a simple 'yes'.

> I took the liberty of creating a fully functional Ai rep for Fortrabbit using your public knowledge base. It is trained to resolve routine inquiries, drastically reducing backlog. Open to a quick walkthrough?

> I came across your LinkedIn profile. I noticed that fortrabbit.com often doesn't appear at the very top on Google & ChatGPT. How about a short, free SEO & GEO workshop? We'll look at what you can do better and give you concrete tips immediately. I look forward to your feedback!

> I don't know which employee benefits you are already using at Fortrabbit. But you can now access well over 400 attractive health services that are really well received - depending on what goal you are pursuing. Particularly popular: Specialist appointment service at private level, massage, osteopathy, physiotherapy, glasses and dental supplementary benefits, psychological prevention. Most companies use these benefits for employee retention, fewer sick days, or to attract new talent. Often in combination with government funding. The easiest way is if we briefly discuss which benefits are most worthwhile for you. Feel free to send appointment suggestions or get in touch briefly, then I will send you some.

> If you're more focused on growth than a sale right now, we'd be happy to connect you with VCs actively investing in your space. We support both exits and capital raises our investor network spans strategic acquirers, PE firms, and growth-stage VCs. Would you like a few warm intros?

> I hear this statement from IT managing directors again and again: "How much time do I have to invest with you to win new customers?" The honest answer: A single video from you, we take care of the rest. After that, the system runs automatically and generates appointments in your calendar while you go about your daily business. In the video I already sent you, you can see exactly how we implement this and how you can win new customers in a predictable way.

> Wanted to let you know that you're doing something good. I stumbled upon fortrabbit through ChatGPT, man. Pretty awesome. I'm reaching out because I was wondering if you'd be interested in a white-label AI chatbot for your clients, which you can deploy or upsell your existing clients again and again with one click? I think you could easily add $1k-$5k per client to your revenue stream with this ready-to-go solution. I can help you set this up for one time and only pay when you actually make an upsell. My background, I help local businesses implement AI to increase their productivity and revenue. What do you think?.

> I hope you've been doing well. I sent you an email a few days ago regarding ISP's and MSP's Decision makers but haven't heard back from you yet, May I share a few sample contacts and the price list for your review? Kindly reply with the details below:

> If selling isn't a current priority, that's absolutely okay. I'd be pleased to provide a current valuation of your organization, a forecast of its future price if specific problems are optimized, and the steps you may follow to enhance its worth. Shall we connect briefly?
