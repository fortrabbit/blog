Today marks a significant milestone in fortrabbit's journey. Here is the public beta of our next-generation hosting platform. We didn't just update our existing platform; we **completely reimagined** what we believe modern PHP hosting should look like. It's been years in the making.

- [Mission statement 2023](/mission-statement-2023) - late 2023
- [Why we rewrite](/yes-we-rewrite) - early 2025

Fingers crossed you like it. 🤞

## One unified stack

Gone are the days of choosing between Universal Apps and Professional Apps. Our new platform combines the best of both worlds:

- **Persistent storage** with direct SSH/SFTP access
- **Component based pricing** individually book and scale parts
- **Workers** offload tasks to the background
- **Key-value store** (coming soon)
- **Free trial** available for each new app
- **Transparent pricing** with our component-based model
- **No setup fees** or hidden costs
- **Pay-as-you-scale** philosophy
- **GitHub signup**
- **Connect any GitHub repository**
- **Push to deploy**
- **Multi-environment staging** with branch-based environments
- **Intuitive dashboard** that gets out of your way
- **Advanced build pipeline** with Node.js support during deployment
- **SSH key-only authentication** for better security

## From alpha to beta

Our alpha testers have been incredible. Their feedback shaped major improvements, from bugs to ideas we could not think of.

## No rush for existing clients

We know switching platforms can be daunting. The old platform we run in parallel for a long time and we will support you hands on with the migration.

- **Side-by-side operation** - both platforms will run in parallel
- **Self-service migration** for early adopters
- **Assisted migration program** planned for later

## Beta pricing and availability

The new platform is **now open to everyone**. It's paid. We want to test the pricing as well. Some parts are still rough and some details are missing.

## What's next?

This beta launch is just the beginning. We've got a full back log. For the next stage we plan to make it features complete and harden the platform by hosting real websites and web applications.

## Ready to experience the future?

Whether you're building your first PHP application or managing dozens of production sites, our new platform is designed to make your life easier and your applications faster.
