It's been years in the making: thousands of tickets, countless cups of coffee, endless debates about tiny details. Now we let it go. This is not just another update. We built something entirely new from scratch. We **completely redefined** our optimal vision of PHP hosting. It's a big bet. Fingers crossed you like it. 🤞

## What is fortrabbit anyhow?

Inspired by the original Heroku PaaS: a hosting platform to deploy modern PHP websites and web applications. It's apps, not servers; it integrates GitHub, runs on AWS, and won't break your bank. It encourages best practices, but doesn't judge you when you ignore them. It's a good fit for modern PHP-based websites and web applications built with Craft CMS, Kirby, Statamic, Laravel, Symfony, and many more.

- **Intuitive dashboard** that gets out of your way
- **Persistent storage** with direct SSH/SFTP access
- **Component based pricing** individually book and scale parts
- **Workers** offload tasks to the background
- **Free trial** available for each new app
- **Transparent pricing** with component-based model
- **No setup fees** or hidden costs
- **Pay-as-you-scale** philosophy
- **GitHub signup**
- **Connect any GitHub repository** git push to deploy
- **Build pipeline** with Node.js support during deployment
- **Multi-environment staging** with branch-based environments
- **SSH key-only authentication** for better security
- **Key-value store** (coming soon)

## Why a BETA for a hosting service?

I've written about our [decision to do a big rewrite](/yes-we-rewrite.md) before. We needed a complete overhaul. We've been working on the new platform for years. It became our home and we quite like it. It's time now. While we are still polishing some edges and adding features, the core experience are ready.

Opening it up is exciting, but also a bit scary. We are stepping out of our comfort zone to see how you interact with the platform. It's already a significant upgrade over the old platform. It's ready for action.

- **Now open to everyone**
- It's paid. We are confident in the value it provides.
- We are rapidly refining the experience.

## New design

Building on the existing brand, the design language got an update. We still use the old logo; colors and typography have been refreshed.

## Updated web properties

- [dash.fortrabbit.com](https://dash.fortrabbit.com) - new dashboard ([old ones are still here](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com))
- [www.fortrabbit.com](https://www.fortrabbit.com) - new marketing (replaced old)
- [blog.fortrabbit.com](https://blog.fortrabbit.com) - new blog (replaced old)
- [docs.fortrabbit.com](https://docs.fortrabbit.com) - new docs ([old ones are still here](https://help.fortrabbit.com))

## New legal section

We have reviewed and extended our legal center. The new legal docs are applicable for all existing and new customers, covering the old and the new platform. The updates are done for clarify.

- [fortrabbit.com/legal](https://www.fortrabbit.com/legal) - New legal center
- [github.com/fortrabbit/legal](https://github.com/fortrabbit/legal) - Legal docs with full changelog

## No rush for existing clients

The old platform continues to run in parallel, giving you plenty of time. We'll support you hands-on with the migration when you are ready.

- **Side-by-side operation** - both platforms will run in parallel
- **Self-service migration** for early adopters
- **Assisted migration program** planned for later

- [New and old](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/new-and-old): side by side
- [Changes](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/changes): old and new platform compared
- [Migration](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/migration): timing and details

## What's next?

This BETA launch is just the beginning. We've got a full backlog. Next, we are working to make it feature-complete and even more robust by hosting more production websites and web applications. From that list:

- Live server metrics in the dashboard
- Live logging in the dashboard
- Live event log in the dashboard
- Event notification system
- Extended collaboration
- Key-value store

### PHP 8.5(.1)

We are preparing for PHP 8.5 and will roll it out as soon as all supported extensions are updated and tested. We want to ensure a smooth transition, so we'll likely release it with the first dot version.
