It's been years in the making: thousands of tickets, countless cups of coffee, endless debates about tiny details. Now we let it go. This is not just another update. We built something entirely new from scratch. We **completely reimagined** what modern PHP hosting can look like. It's our biggest bet. Fingers crossed you like it. 🤞

## What is fortrabbit anyhow?

Inspired by the original Heroku PaaS: a hosting platform to deploy modern PHP websites and web applications. It's apps, not servers; it integrates GitHub, runs on AWS, and won't break your bank. It encourages best practices, but doesn't judge you when you ignore them. It's a good fit for modern PHP-based websites and web applications built with Craft CMS, Kirby, Statamic, Laravel, Symfony, and many more.

- **Intuitive dashboard** that gets out of your way
- **Persistent storage** with direct SSH/SFTP access
- **Component based pricing** individually book and scale parts
- **Workers** offload tasks to the background
- **Free trial** available for each new app
- **Transparent pricing** with component-based model
- **No setup fees** or hidden costs
- **Pay-as-you-scale** philosophy
- **GitHub signup**
- **Connect any GitHub repository** git push to deploy
- **Build pipeline** with Node.js support during deployment
- **Multi-environment staging** with branch-based environments
- **SSH key-only authentication** for better security
- **Key-value store** (coming soon)

## Why a BETA for a hosting service?

I've written about our [decision to do a big rewrite](/yes-we-rewrite.md) before. This is the next step. We've been working on the new platform for years. It became our home and we quite like it. Opening it up is scary. It's not perfect yet. There are still a few rough edges and some really nice features are still missing. What if people don't like it—or just don't notice at all?

We need to get out of the cozy comfort zone and face the reality of people interacting with the platform.

- **Now open to everyone**
- It's paid. We want to test the pricing as well.
- Some parts are still rough and some details are missing.

## New design

Building on the existing brand, the design language got an update. We still use the old logo; colors and typography have been refreshed.

## Updated web properties

## New legal section

We have reviewed and extended our legal center. The new version is applicable for all existing and new clients, covering the old and the new platform. The updates are done for clarify.

- [github.com/fortrabbit/legal](https://github.com/fortrabbit/legal) - Legal docs with full changelog

## No rush for existing clients

The old platform continues to run in parallel for a long time and we'll support you hands-on with the migration.

- **Side-by-side operation** – both platforms will run in parallel
- **Self-service migration** for early adopters
- **Assisted migration program** planned for later

- [New and old](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/new-and-old): side by side
- [Changes](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/changes): old and new platform compared
- [Migration](https://docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/migration): timing and details

## What's next?

This beta launch is just the beginning. We've got a full backlog. Next, we plan to make it feature-complete and harden the platform by hosting more production websites and web applications.
