It's been years in the making: thounsands of tickets, countless cups of coffee, endless debates about tiniest details. Now we let it go. This is not just another update; we built something entirely new from scratch. We **completely reimagined** what we believe modern PHP hosting should look like. It's our biggest bet. Fingers crossed you like it. 🤞

## What is fortrabbit?

Imagine if Heroku and Vercel had a PHP baby. A hosting platform to deploy modern PHP websites and web applications. It's Apps not servers, integrates GitHub, runs on AWS, but won't break your bank. It encourages best practices, but doesn't judge you when you ignore them. It'a good for Craft CMS, Kirby, Statamic, Laravel, Symfony and many more.

- **Intuitive dashboard** that gets out of your way
- **Persistent storage** with direct SSH/SFTP access
- **Component based pricing** individually book and scale parts
- **Workers** offload tasks to the background
- **Free trial** available for each new app
- **Transparent pricing** with component-based model
- **No setup fees** or hidden costs
- **Pay-as-you-scale** philosophy
- **GitHub signup**
- **Connect any GitHub repository** git push to deploy
- **Build pipeline** with Node.js support during deployment
- **Multi-environment staging** with branch-based environments
- **SSH key-only authentication** for better security
- **Key-value store** (coming soon)

## New web properties

- [dash.fortrabbit.com](https://dash.fortrabbit.com) - new dashboard ([old ones are still here](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com))
- [www.fortrabbit.com](https://www.fortrabbit.com) - new marketing (replaced old)
- [blog.fortrabbit.com](https://blog.fortrabbit.com) - new blog (replaced old)
- [docs.fortrabbit.com](https://docs.fortrabbit.com) - new docs for the new platform ([old ones are still here](https://help.fortrabbit.com))

## No rush for existing clients

Switching platforms is daunting. The old platform we run in parallel for a long time and we will support you hands on with the migration.

- **Side-by-side operation** - both platforms will run in parallel
- **Self-service migration** for early adopters
- **Assisted migration program** planned for later

- [New and old](https:///docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/new-and-old): side by side
- [Changes](https:///docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/changes): Old and new platform compared
- [Migration](https:///docs.fortrabbit.com/platform/new/migration): Timing and details

## Beta pricing and availability

The new platform is **now open to everyone**. It's paid. We want to test the pricing as well. Some parts are still rough and some details are missing.

## What's next?

This beta launch is just the beginning. We've got a full back log. For the next stage we plan to make it features complete and harden the platform by hosting real websites and web applications.

## We want your feedback

Don't just sit here. Deploy something!
