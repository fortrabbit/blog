intro: Google's browser dominance threatens the open web.
lead: This article holds no news. Google Chrome is the most used web browser. I am worried about competition, privacy, the future of web standards and individual user choice. This is my opinion as a web developer.

The current browser landscape shows how Chrome's market share dwarfs its competitors.

| Browser                                 | Market share |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------: |
| Google Chrome                           |         ~65% |
| Safari                                  |         ~15% |
| Microsoft Edge                          |          ~5% |
| Firefox                                 |          ~3% |
| Opera                                   |          ~2% |
| Other (Brave, Arc, Dia, Zen, Vivaldi …) |          ~5% |

This is a simplified view not considering mobile / desktop and operatig systems.

## My initial Chrome experience

In 2009 authoring CSS was still playing mockawhole with Internet Explorer. Then Google Chrome came around. It was lightweight and powerful. Everything Google produced was fresh and existing back then. Chrome tookoff and helped to push web standards and to crack up the Internet Explorer dominance. It also has put pressure on Apple to improve on Safari (WebKit). I am so thankful for that.

## The Problem

Chrome's dominance creates four key risks:

- **Web standards control** - Google pushes proprietary features and standards that benefit their services
- **Privacy Erosion** - Chrome feeds browsing data directly into Google's advertising algorithms
- **Innovation Stagnation** - Reduced competitive pressure slows development
- **Lock-in** - Sites optimize for Chrome first, often exclusively

## Examples

- WEI - Web Environment Integrity API - exemplified would have let websites block non-approved browsers, creating a DRM-style gatekeeper system.
- AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages
- CWV - Core Web vitals initative
- permission element proposal
- uBlock Origin
- Perfmatters

## Why It Matters

Browser choice isn't just personal preference—it's about preserving the open, decentralized nature of the internet. A diverse browser ecosystem means better security, more innovation, and stronger privacy protections.

Remember to don't be evil.
