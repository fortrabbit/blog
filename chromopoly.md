lead: Google Chrome is the most used web browser. I am worried about competition, privacy and the future of web standards. No revealing news here, just my view as a web developer.

| Browser                                          | Market share |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -----------: |
| Google Chrome                                    |         ~65% |
| Safari                                           |         ~15% |
| Microsoft Edge                                   |          ~5% |
| Firefox                                          |          ~3% |
| Opera                                            |          ~2% |
| Other (Brave, Arc, Dia, Zen, Vivaldi, Samsung …) |         ~10% |

The current browser landscape shows how Chrome's market share dwarfs its competitors. This is a simplified view not considering mobile / desktop and operatig systems much.

## My Chrome journey

In 2009 authoring CSS was still playing mockawhole with Internet Explorer. Then Google Chrome came around. It was lightweight and powerful. Everything Google produced was fresh back then. Chrome tookoff and helped to push web standards and to crack up the Internet Explorer dominance. It also has put pressure on Apple to improve on Safari (WebKit). I am so thankful for all that.

## Advocacy

Over the years I became more and more reserved about new initiatives and web developer resources originating from the Googleverse. I don't click on search results from [web.dev](https://web.dev/) any more.

I work in support with our web hosting clients where performance related topics often come up. I see developers trying to achieve best practices according to 'Core Web Vitals' (CWV) to improve their 'Lighthouse' score. This can include optimizations like above the fold CSS inlining, while missing a lot of basics.

Google Chrome team invents, but the rest of the web is just too slow. Slide from a recent talk by [Bramus](https://www.bram.us/) [Watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njdiu83do0M). Other CSS heroes like Rachel Andrew and Philip Walton also joined the Google developer relations team.

### Google web platform innovations

As a UI/UX person I am excited about new browser features like scroll animations and page transitions, or typographic improvments like `text-wrap: pretty`. But I can wait a bit until they will become standarized and mainstream available, specifically when there is a good fallback (progressive enhancement).

Remember Houdini, the 'future' of CSS - back in 2016? There for sure are good improvements from the Google web team, but there are a few that I found questionable, such as:

- WEI - Web Environment Integrity API
- AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages
- Permission element proposal - [Goolge blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/permission-element-origin-trial), [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44281633)

## Alternatives

I keep using Firefox, specifically because uBlock Origin is still available (hello Manifest V3). But it should not be forgotten that Firefox major revenue source (75%?) is for the default search engine deal with Google.

## In closing

I'd like to see an open, decentralized internet. I believe a diverse browser ecosystem with more competition means better security, more innovation, and stronger privacy protections. I read about growing influecence on standard specification via WHATWG / W3C, but I am missing insights.

Is it time for antitrust action? I don't know. Up until, please remember to don't be evil.
