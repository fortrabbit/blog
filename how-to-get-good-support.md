## Do this

### Read, Search, Ask

Consider the following pattern when you have a question:

1. **Read** - Our [documentation](https://help.fortrabbit.com) covers all general topics 
3. **Search** - See error logs, check Google & Stack Overflow
4. **Ask** - Haven't found an answer? Ask us!

This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it's the most respectful of other people's time, too. And it helps you, to get up running faster on your own.

[See a post about this pattern](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4) established by freeCodeCamp.

### Provide context and details

The more we know, the better we can answer. Please don't make us guess or query you back for details. A good report may contain:

* I have tried to: "…………"
* I do so because: "………"
* I expected: "………………"
* The error I see is: "…………………"
* This is the verbose output of the error: "…………………………………"
* My setup is "…………"
* It works locally: "yes/no"
* It happens all of the time: "yes/no"
* It worked before: "yes/no"
* It affects all of my Apps: "yes/no"
* I have also tried this alternative way: "………………"
* I have also tried this workaround: "………………"

### Tell us who you are

With fortrabbit [an Account is a person](https://help.fortrabbit.com/account) — not a [Company](https://help.fortrabbit.com/company). By providing your name, conversations are getting more personal. With longterm clients we have 100s of conversations and 1000s of replies. We'll get to know each other. This is a relationship.



## Avoid this

### Ping pong games

![Support 1 - ping pong](/dist/img/support-01.png)

Modern customer support systems, like [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) or [alike](https://www.producthunt.com/ask/1829-which-is-the-best-and-free-alternative-to-intercom-io) are chat based. **Your questions are getting conserved and we'll come back on you ASAP**. So like e-mail the conversation doesn't have to happen in real time. Avoid pleasantries and greetings, just be on point and ask right away. 

*"Hello, you there?"  
"Hello anyone?"  
"Hello?"*

### Not a real question

![Support 2](/dist/img/support-02.png)

Make sure to ask a question we can answer. What kind of answer do you expect for "Something is not working"?

### Lazy call

![Support 3](/dist/img/support-03.png)

Our [extensive help pages](https://help.fortrabbit.com) should give you a good overview on how to get started. You'll find our quickly if fortrabbit is for you. Invest in your question and we'll invest in the answer.

### Fuzzy question

![Support 4](/dist/img/support-04.png)

Imagine your car is not starting. You call up your mechanic and just tell him that. Do you expect a solution right away based on the limited information you provided? 

Writing a good question requires some efforts on your side. But that will force you to overthink your problem. In many cases you'll find a solution yourself when thoroughly thinking about the question. Based on sufficient information we are likely to find an answer faster and better.
