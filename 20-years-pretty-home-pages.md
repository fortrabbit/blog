We don't know the exact date, maybe there is none, maybe it's not really important at all. But i think it's notable that the web programming language for pretty homepages is already 20 years old. A lot of people hate PHP, some take it seriously, we love it.

Credit should go to the really nice [history of PHP](https://github.com/open-source-museum/the-history-of-php) project by Yusuke Ando and Tsutomu Kawamura. This is actually just a remix. Is there an error or something important missing? Please tell us!
