We're glad to announce that we've deployed the [PHP XSL extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xsl.php) today allowing you to run [Symphony CMS](http://getsymphony.com/) on fortrabbit! Symphony is a content management system powered by XML an XSLT. It's quite mature, well tested (2.0 was released in 2008, current stable is 2.3.1) and focused on simplicity in design and complete control for the developers. Symphony is completely open source, but [commercial support](http://getsymphony.com/get-support/) is offered. There is a huge set of [extensions](http://getsymphony.com/download/extensions/) and macros in form of [XSLT Utilities](http://getsymphony.com/download/xslt-utilities/). Currently, Symphony is migrating towards PHP 5.4, so there are still some quirks you have to [deal with](http://support.fortrabbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1012692-install-symphony-cms).
