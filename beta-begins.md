We are happy to announce that we have finally started the private BETA of our upcoming PHP Platform. The first invitations are sent out. Thank you for your interest and for waiting so long.**

### Informations for BETA Testers

During the BETA period all services are free. Even when prices are shown, nothing will be charged. Accounting is one of the things that needs to be tested. The BETA period is not going to be very long. We think it will be only a few months. Expect some hiccups! We are already running some live websites on it, but not suggest that you should to do so as well. We still do load tests, DOS attacks and other stuff to stress the system. Please share your thoughts with us! It is extremely important for us, what you think about the service. Do you understand everything? Where do you have problems? What are you missing?
