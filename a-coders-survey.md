We have asked everyone interested in a BETA of our upcoming platform a few questions on hosting. That included very valuable feedback for us. Surprisingly we learned that such data was not available on the web. So we have done this little web survey for developers and designers with a wider range (than just hosting). Apply now until and help to make the web a better place (for developers):

* [coders-survey.com](http://coders-survey.com/)

Results will be published on the 1st of September 2012. This little weekend project is also a little test for our platform as it already runs on it. It features a little simple survey CMS which will be published on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortrabbit/coders-survey) the next days.
