### The meat market

All experts agree that meat prices are much too low. The brutal price competition results in factory farming and the massive usage of antibiotics. That's not good - neither for the animals nor for us customers. We eat too much meat and get too fat. **How to fix it**: Go to your butcher of trust. Ask about the welfare of animals and meat quality. Eat meat more consciously. Vote for a party that supports meat market regulation.

### The hosting market

Here competition is also driven by price dumping. Hosting plans are mostly compared by their price tags. Unlike animals bits and bytes are comfortable stored in a tight metal box. But legacy technology, ugly web interfaces and sloppy implementations cause headaches for us web developers. **How to fix it:** Go to your hosting provider of trust. Ask about the infrastructure and deployment. Calculate carefully what is more valuable, a cheap hosting offer or developing productivity?
