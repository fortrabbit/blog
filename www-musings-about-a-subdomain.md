* www stands for World Wide Web and is a relict from the early internet days
* <www>. is hard to spell in english (double you, double you, double you, double you, dot)
* <www>. is just an optional subdomain
* A domain without www is called apex-, naked- or bare-domain
* Print designers like the look - print ads mostly include the <www>. prefix
* Young people tend to skip <www>. when typing in a domain in the address bar of the browser
* Old people always type <www>. before they type the actual domain name
* Some web masters forget to set up this subdomain > 404
* <www>. is coming back with modern cloud hosting (CNAME records, CDNs …)
