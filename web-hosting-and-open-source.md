This is not about Matt Mullenweg, founder of WordPress and Automattic (~$710M 2024 rev), who is angry about the web hosting service WP-Engine (~$400M 2024 rev). It's a much smaller story, it's ours.

## Our history

We started our PHP hosting business around 2012. Laravel was gaining ground. Composer was just released. PHP 7 on the horizon. We were pretty exited about all that PHP. So we aimed to create a hosting service for modern PHP websites and web applications.

We got our initial MVP release out quickly. It was super naive with a few fundamental flaws. Yet, it had git push to deploy and a deployment pipeline with Composer.

The young Laravel community helped us getting started big time. Back then, I did not realized, how crucial and fragile this initial support by the community and those early adaptors was. I thought that our great talent and super product was the reason for initial success. It did not even crossed my mind to invest in a partnership with Laravel.

Time passed and we have been busy to create a 2.0 version of the platform while and keeping the lights on. fortrabbit is bootstrapped. Back then, it was only us three founders. We are product people. We like to build stuff. We are not good at marketing.

In 2014 Taylor Otwell (Laravel) launched Forge, his own hosting service for the Laravel community. This was a big blow for our business, killing our stable inbound channel over night.

We pivoted to get some visibility with the young Craft CMS scene. With modern paradigms Craft CMS matched our platform quite well. We really digged it. This time we invested to have a formal partnership with it's creators (Pixel & Tonic). We became recommended hosting partners, which in return would result in a steady stream of signups.

Eventually, Pixel & Tonic ended our partnership as they prepared to launch their own Craft Cloud hosting service. Again quite a blow for us.

## Open source software and hosting businesses

Open source needs funding and open source entrepreneurship can be a great model. A related business can be the foundation for independent development of the OSS project. From the business perspective, the popularity of an OSS project can translate into business leads. For website or web application software, a hosting solution is a good match, as it is something the users of the software will need anyway. They will be happy to support their heroes.

Vercel is another hosting service with a tight open source software connection. The popular Next.js framework comes from Vercel.

The french PaaS Platform.sh is very close to Symfony project. The Symfony founder Fabien Potencier now works for them.

## Our strategy

We don't have deep pockets to buy in on an OSS project. We don't have time, energy and also not a good idea to build OSS to support our hosting business unit. We are only providing a web hosting solution. Nothing else. We aim to create a great product ([new platform in the making](https://new.fortrabbit.com)) that works well and is fun to use for developers. We don't aim for world domination, our business works with a tiny market share.

## The other side

We use a lot of open source software to run our business.
